## Fertiliser

The label of the fertiliser sold by Agrilution lists the following contents:

The bottle also says it was made in the UK by "Growth Technology Ltd.".

The contents above _exactly_ match the 
[contents listed by Growth Technology](https://www.growthtechnology.com/resources/uploads/products/GT3835_Formulex_1_litre1596640653.jpg)
for their product "Formulex".

We've been using Formulex instead of Agrilution's fertiliser since mid-2022
without problems.

### When to refill?

I've analyzed the electrical conductivity measurements from the dumps. The
results can be seen in
[this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WozNsuoyWCZq33nOVKqihboraT5Xo0jwelI0DY_o3i0/edit#gid=0).
The graph shows the Plantcube consistently asking for 15ml exactly 10 days after
nutrient was refilled. Only one message differs from this pattern: 50ml is
requested on 2023-08-14. Although this certainly seems warranted given the EC
value, it's unclear what exactly triggers it (there were prior lower EC
readings, so it's something more complex than a simple trigger level). In any
event, it seems that attempting to maintain an EC level between 1250 and 1500
should produce acceptable results.


## Cleaning tabs

The Agrilution cleaning tabs state that they're made by the Austrian company
"claro products GmbH". There are no further details to further work out which of
the company's products it could be. The tabs are completely white and the
wrapping is water-soluble. The 
[100% Classic Geschirrspültabs](https://www.claro.at/de/produkt/claro-100-prozent-classic-geschirrspueltabs/)
appear to be a match, but having ordered some of those, they're close but
they're not the same thing.

Before Agrilution themselves sold cleaning tabs, they recommended that one
should use a normal dishwasher tab dissolved in boiling water and added to the
water tank before beginning the cleaning cycle. The selection of cleaning tab
therefore can't really be critical.

## Seedbars

The Seedbars appear to made from coconut soil (aka coconut coir). First attempts
to press damp coconut soil into a seedtray and then to dry it have produced
acceptable (if not perfect) results. I'm planing to design a small 3D-printed
press for the seedbars to ease the process and to create the small recesses in
which to place seeds.

## Filters

Not yet investigated. The material appears to match that from normal aquarium or
pond filters.
